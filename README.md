# Pig Game

This is my third project using JavaScript, and I really liked how this one turned out.

I created it inside The Complete JavaScript Course, taught by Jonas Schmedtmann. All of the HTML and CSS was done by him, but the JavaScript was done by me.

If you would like to play the game, you can do so here: https://designcode06.github.io/pig-game

Have fun!

## Game Instructions
### Number of Players: 2
- During the player's turn, he'll roll the dice as long as he wants. However, if he rolls a 1, his turn is over, and the points that he rolled during his turn won't be added to his score.
- If the player decides to end his turn, he can do so by 'holding' his points. Meaning that the points he rolled during that turn will be added to his score.
- The first player to 100 wins!
